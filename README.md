# Sandwich-Shop
This is a collaboration project I completed with two other group members in my course using php. We created an online ordering system where users are able to build their own sandwich by picking their sandwich size (6 inch or 12 inch) as well as meats, toppings, and sauces. As the user builds their sandwich, their final price is updated at the bottom of the screen using GA sales tax (this can be changed). They can then place their order for pickup deciding whether they will use cash or card to finalize payment at the store with a final order confirmation. Team members who work at the shop can sign into their work accounts and view the shop's inventory to see what meats, toppings, and sauces need to be ordered for the store.
