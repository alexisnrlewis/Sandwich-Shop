# Sandwich-Shop
This is a collaboration project I completed with two other group members in my course using php. We created an online ordering system where users are able to build their own sandwich with meats, toppings, and sauces. They can then place their order for pickup with a final order confirmation. Team members who work at the shop can sign into their work accounts and view the shop's inventory to see what meats, toppings, and sauces need to be ordered.
